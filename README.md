# Advanced Survey Analysis & Statistical Modeling in R

This repository contains professional-grade tutorials and data pipelines for analyzing major Social Science datasets. It focuses on handling Large-N survey data with complex sampling designs using the latest R ecosystem.

### Included Tutorials
* **ANES 2024:** Advanced workflows for the 2024 American National Election Studies data.
* **GSS 2024:** Statistical analysis of the General Social Survey, including a custom-curated and cleaned subset.
* **ANES 2020:** Longitudinal analysis and data processing.


### Technical Competencies
* **Survey Weighting:** Implementation of complex weights (e.g., `wtssps`) to ensure population representativeness.
* **Large-N Analysis:** Efficient processing of high-dimensional datasets.
* **Statistical Modeling:** Weighted linear regressions, data distrubution and visualization, outlier treatment, and publication-quality table generation with `gtsummary`.
* **Reproducible Research:** All workflows are documented via **Quarto (.qmd)** for full transparency and reproducibility.

### 📂 Repository Contents
* **`*.qmd`**: Source code for all tutorials.
* **`*.html`**: Rendered professional reports (viewable via GitHub Pages).
* **`gss2024_cleaned.RData`**: A curated subset of the GSS 2024 for streamlined analysis.
